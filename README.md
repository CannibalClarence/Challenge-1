## Notes/What I changed
<ol>
<li>
    Added semantic tags for header and footer removed class "header and footer" since we are using semantic tags now.
</li>
<li>
    Changed class selector for header and footer in css
</li>
<li>
    Replaced header "div" with "nav" 
</li>
<li>
    Replaced .header div in css to .header nav
<li>
    Added an id for search engine optimization so the link properly directs
</li>
<li>
    Changed div tags to section tags for the search engine optimization, online reputation, and social media marketing sections. Because they have headers and p tags so it is more clear than div.
</li>
<li>
    Changed lead generation, brand awareness and cost management section div tag to a "aside" tag because it relay's better info to the reader of what the container is for. The content is to the side of the main page content. 
</li>
<li>
    In the CSS for benefit-lead, Brand, and Cost I consolidated space for the main class the H3 and the img rules into just 3 rules rather than 9 seperate rules.
<li> 
    Restructured order of CSS rules so that they work from the top down parallel to the HTML
</li>
<li>
In the CSS, the Rules for search-eninge-optimization, online-reputation-management, and social-media-marketing I consolidated the main class , the H2 , and the img rules into 3 rules rather than 9
